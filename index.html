                        <p>Chester Charles Bennington was born on March 20, 1976, in Phoenix, Arizona. His mother was a
                            nurse, while his father was a police detective who worked on child sexual abuse cases.
                            Bennington took an interest in music at a young age, citing the bands Depeche Mode and Stone
                            Temple Pilots as his earliest inspirations, and dreamed of becoming a member of Stone Temple
                            Pilots, which he later achieved when he became their lead singer. </p>

                        <h2>1993</h2>
                        <p>Bennington first began singing with a band called Sean Dowdell and His Friends? They released
                            an eponymous three-track cassette in 1993. Later, Dowdell and Bennington moved on to form a
                            new band, Grey Daze, a post-grunge band from Phoenix, Arizona. The band recorded three
                            albums: Demo in 1993, Wake/Me in 1994, and ...no sun today in 1997. Bennington left Grey
                            Daze in 1998, but struggled to find another band. </p>

                            for a time when his mother discovered his drug activity. He worked at a Burger King before
                            starting his career as a professional musician. </p>

                        <p>Bennington had a child, Jaime (born May 12, 1996), from his relationship with Elka Brand. In
                            2006, he adopted Brand's other son, Isaiah (born November 8, 1997). He married his first
                            wife, Samantha Marie Olit, on October 31, 1996. They had one child together, Draven
                            Sebastian (born April 19, 2002). Bennington's relationship with his first wife declined
                            during his early years with Linkin Park, and they divorced in 2005. In 2006, he married
                            Talinda Ann Bentley, a former Playboy model with whom he had three children: Tyler Lee
                            Bennington (born March 16, 2006) and twins Lilly and Lila (born November 6, 2011). </p>

                        <h2>October 24, 2000</h2>
                        <p>On October 24, 2000, Linkin Park released their debut album, Hybrid Theory, through Warner
                            Bros. Records. Bennington and Shinoda wrote the lyrics to Hybrid Theory based on some early
                            material. Shinoda characterized the lyrics as interpretations of universal feelings,
                            emotions, and experiences, and as "everyday emotions you talk about and think about."
                            Bennington later described the songwriting experience to Rolling Stone magazine in early
                            2002, "It's easy to fall into that thing – 'poor, poor me', that's where songs like
                            'Crawling' come from: I can't take myself. But that song is about taking responsibility for
                            your actions. I don't say 'you' at any point. It's about how I'm the reason that I feel this
                            way. There's something inside me that pulls me down." Bennington primarily served as Linkin
                            Park's lead vocalist, but occasionally shared the role with Shinoda. All Music Guide
                            described Bennington's vocals as "higher-pitched" and "emotional", in contrast to Shinoda's
                            hip-hop-style delivery. Both members also worked together to write lyrics for the band's
                            songs. </p>

                            with Orgy and Julien-K members Amir Derakh and Ryan Shuck in 2005. Dead by Sunrise made
                            their live debut in May 2008, performing four songs at the 13th anniversary party for Club
                            Tattoo in Tempe, Arizona. </p>

                            Chains and performed the song "Man in the Box" at KROQ's Inland Invasion Festival in 2006.
                            Bennington performed with Kings of Chaos during their six-show 2016 concert tour. </p>

                            intervention in 2006, Bennington was able to overcome his drug addiction; he would go on to
                            denounce drug use in future interviews. In 2011, he said he had quit drinking, noting, "I

                            nobody, even in a free society, has the right to take another person's life. Ever. That's

                        <p>In February 2013, Stone Temple Pilots parted ways with long-time lead singer Scott Weiland.
                            The band recruited Bennington to replace Weiland in May 2013. On May 18, 2013, Bennington
                            took the stage at KROQ's Weenie Roast with the band. The setlist included original Stone
                            Temple Pilots songs, as well as their first single with Bennington on vocals called "Out of
                            Time", which debuted on May 19 and was available for free download via their official
                            website. It was later announced by Chester and the band in an exclusive KROQ interview that
                            he was officially the new frontman of Stone Temple Pilots and discussed the possibility of a
                            new album and tour. The song "Out of Time" is featured on their EP High Rise, which was
                            released on October 8, 2013. </p>

                            vibe. Stone Temple Pilots has this sexier, more classic rock feel to it. Linkin Park is a
                            very modern, very tech-heavy type of band. I grew up listening to these guys. When this
                            opportunity came up, it was just like a no-brainer." Bennington stated in interviews that
                            singing lead vocals in Stone Temple Pilots was his lifelong dream. He left the band on good
                            terms due to his commitments with Linkin Park in 2015. </p>

                        <p>Bennington injured his ankle in January 2015 during a basketball game. He attempted to cope
                            with the injury and perform with the aid of crutches and a knee scooter. Linkin Park later
                            canceled the remainder of their tour to allow Bennington to undergo surgery and recover.

                            discovered his body around 9:00 a.m. PDT on July 20, 2017. His death was ruled a suicide by
                            hanging. Mike Shinoda confirmed his death on Twitter, writing, "Shocked and heartbroken, but
                            it's true. An official statement will come out as soon as we have one". On July 21, Brian
                            Elias, the chief of operations for the office of the medical examiner-coroner, confirmed
                            that a half-empty bottle of alcohol was found at the scene, but no other drugs were present.
                            The band announced that they had canceled the North American leg of their One More Light
                            Tour following Bennington's death and that tickets would be refunded. </p>
